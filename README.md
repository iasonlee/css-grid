# css blog grid

A grid layout with some styling for blog-like sites. The main focus is on minimalism, legibility, and functionality across all device sizes (no unexpected overflows).

The layout of the index along with the styles are intended for use with site generators as the single page where the 'posts' follow the styling of the grid.
